This analysis was done with Power BI.
Nestle as the largest food company in the World want to expand its business by adding new product lines. However, the Management requested to know the performance of the current products. The analysis was done with Power BI. My Team discovered through the analysis and visualization that Nestle generated about $31m from selling 18,000 units of 9 products between 2018-2020 and over 77% of the entire revenue was gotten from the direct sales medium, while less than 23% of the revenue was generated through the online sales medium
